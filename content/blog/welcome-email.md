Hey friend,

My name is Andrew Kim and I've been trying to get a side project off the ground lately.
This newsletter is my attempt to document this journey.

I know that your inbox is hallowed ground, so thank you from the bottom of my heart.
I'm going to try my hardest to deliver quick hitting value and insights.

As a welcome gift here are [24 questions I used for reviewing my past year and planning for the new one](https://www.notion.so/akinhwan/24-Questions-for-reflecting-on-the-past-year-and-envisioning-the-next-7902509142274c54a9f26fa6452cd665).

### What is a "full time maker"
A person who works for themselves making a living on the internet with side project(s).
I have thus far been a part time maker due to my day job. 
But the dream is to quit working for the man, and focus 100% on my own endeavours.
I believe that everyone who can, should strive to make a living for themselves online.

### What can you expect?
You are somone who makes their living using a computer and has dreamed of or wondered what it would be like to work for yourself on your own side projects full time.

I will serve as a guinea pig, sharing what I've learned in my approach to validating, building, and launching products.
This is the messy behind the scenes action, not a perfectly edited youtube tutorial or masterclass video.
This is going to be as real and raw as it gets, and you should probably get some popcorn.

In short I'm going to use this template so that this process of sharing is a bit more systematic.
- 🔥 Highlights from this week
- 💔 Lowlights from this week
- ✅ Completed this week
🎯 Goals for next week
- a curation consisting of links, songs, podcasts, pictures, etc.

### When can you expect it?
Every Sunday evening @ 10pm in your inbox.

### Why I'm doing this newsletter?

1. To give others the courage, inspiration, and insight to create their own projects.
2. The oportunity to connect with so many curious individuals around the world!
3. Because I feel like I have something to share in my process.
4. To become a better writer, a deeper thinker, and clearer communicator.
5. To be held accountable to an audience.
