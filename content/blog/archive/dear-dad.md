First of all, I'm sorry that I blew up.
I shouldn't have screamed at you like you.
As if you were some enemy, and not my father.

I've had a lot of time to reflect on why I did such a thing.
At the time, I was tired, hungry, stressed, and didn't feel like being lectured or punished.
I'm a 30 year old man now, and I don't like being treated like a kid.
In the past I would have just been obedient, but I'm stubborn.

But I agree that as long as I live under your roof, I am privy to your rules.
There will come a day soon when I will indeed move out.
I've been lucky to have such caring parents.
At the same time, I definitely need my own space carved out.
Just as you have your particulars, I do as well.
We are bound to clash like this every so often.

The best we can hope for is to move on, forget about how this episode made us feel,
but remember what we can learn from it.

I believe because of our microaggressions toward each other, our prides were gradually bruised until we finally erupted.

Also it is difficult being locked up indoors all day with the same people.
