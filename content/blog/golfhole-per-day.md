Starting a social media campaign where you design one golf hole every day with the help of ChatGPT and DALL-E is a creative and engaging idea. Here's a plan to help ensure its success:

1. **Define Your Goal**: Clarify what you want to achieve - whether it's gaining followers, engaging with the golf community, or showcasing your creativity.

2. **Create a Content Calendar**: Plan your posts in advance. Decide on themes or specific elements for each day's golf hole design, like famous courses, fictional settings, challenging terrains, etc.

3. **Leverage ChatGPT and DALL-E**: Use ChatGPT to brainstorm ideas and write compelling descriptions. Use DALL-E to visually bring these ideas to life.

4. **Engage Your Audience**: Include interactive elements, like asking followers to suggest ideas for the next day's hole or vote on their favorite designs.

5. **Regular Posting Schedule**: Consistency is key. Post at the same time every day to build anticipation.

6. **Use Hashtags and Tags**: Utilize relevant hashtags and tag golf-related accounts to increase visibility.

7. **Cross-Promote on Other Platforms**: Share your content on different social media platforms to reach a wider audience.

8. **Track Your Progress**: Monitor engagement (likes, shares, comments) and adjust your strategy based on what resonates with your audience.

9. **Collaborate with Influencers**: Partner with golf influencers or enthusiasts to expand your reach.

10. **Feedback and Adaptation**: Listen to your audienceâ€™s feedback and be flexible to adapt your content accordingly.

Remember, the success of a social media campaign often relies on creativity, consistency, and engagement with the community. Good luck!
