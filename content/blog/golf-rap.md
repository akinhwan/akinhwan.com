It feels incredible laying into a drive with my whole body.
Not just my body weight, but my mind, soul, and spirit.
I feel like I'm in a trance, and I'm not even thinking about what I'm doing.
I'm just doing it.
I'm just being.
I'm just feeling.
I'm just existing.
I'm just being.
I'm just being.


I'm just being.
I'm just being.
I'm just being.
I'm just being.
I'm just being.
I'm just being.
I'm just being.
I'm just being.
I'm just being.

coaxing it in like quaxacotl
trying to remember a rhyme from a waking drive

halfway there to the halfway house
a world away from a whirwind bout
long putts drilled through the back of the cup

sky hooks, punch draws, dirty or fluffy bunkers,  and flop shots.

on and off, up and downs
left and right, tee shot drives
long and short, lags and taps
in and out, the cart path bounces
