# What you want

I was recently laid off. And in the process I've been laid bare.
All the broken processes of my life, now showing themselves through the gaps.

All my hopes and dreams, now coming to a front. Face to face with my fears.

I had a recent phone conversation with my brother while driving from Dublin to redwood city.
He sincerely and emphatically asked me, "No, what do you actually want?"
Apart from expectation, devoid of over intellectualization and rationalization.
What does your heart of heart desire in this life.
Without the need for money, or any base needs.
Getting to the why of whys for the very tip of maslow's hierarchy, can be surprisingly difficult.

Especially given that most people around the world seem to be furiously working away like busy bees.
The lucky ones are aligned in their work, passion, desires, and needs.

Unsurprisingly, I had not been while at my last job.
We're not going to make this a post about my grievance, my shortcomings, the specifics of business reality.
The move has been made for me, as I was escorted out of the building.
And in the following days I have been rattled. Rattling my brain for sure, on what to do next.

You tell a friend you're laid off and the first thing they ask is, "So what are you going to do next? So what now?"

It's a great question don't get me wrong, but everyone in my position wants the "right" answer.
The only way to get to it is deep mindful reflection. Combined with an anxiety-free period where you explore your natural talents, proclivities, and interests.

Hopefully you don't need a sign. You can just lift your head and see the sign all around you in what you're doing.

I for one, know that I'm creative. Ever since I was a little brattish kid, I've loved showing off what I did. 
Raising my hand faster than others, bringing things from home for show and tell. Wearing tennis wrist sweat bands to a hagwon?
Making custom lego creations for my friend's parents to see. 

And even now in the world of software engineering, I most enjoy the part where I see other's expressions change as they experience the interface that I've build or contributed to.

There's also the problem solving moment, but what's important is in the journey map. In the course of a product, where do you find that moment you're most attached to? Is it in the supply chain logistics as things are not planned yet? Is it in delivering it the final mile to a customer's door front? This sort of thing is better to be specific.

I want more than anything to ___.

I want more than anything, to be self sufficient.
Why? because I don't want to burden any one else. because I want the satisfaction and respect of having done it my way.
why? because I care what others think of me.
because i am not as independt as I think i am, even as an only child. or possible because i am an only child
because i know i can be great, but scared of it not happening
i fear a life of mediocrity
because i've seen other's living it and it didn't seem appealing to me
but then again i've never seen the miserable interior life of super "successful" people up close anyways.

i have dozens of ideas taped up on my wall. each one of them a gem in my mind. but whether they can be polished by me and delivered to the public is a matter of trial and error.
i simply need to create a plan, and tap into my inner PM. A PM ai assistant would work wonders for people like me.

one by one as fast as possible, striking while the iron is hot, executing while the motivation is there, doing it while the attention is present, locking in while the focus is dialed.
