<!-- Starting a newsletter feels momentous. But maybe I shouldn't think of it this seriously.
I realized that I should be producing and interacting with others constantly, to have any chance of providing value.
I'm honored that you would take the time to see my perspective.
I truly hope that its inspiring or insightful. -->

Hey friend,

I'm writing to you from my cold basement, with way too many tabs open. 2021 feels like its going to be a momentous year for all of us. What are some things you have planned for the year of the Metal Ox?

🔥 Highlights
- I recorded a podcast episode with [Jakob Greenfeld](http://jakobgreenfeld.com/) for his [Product Ideas show](https://open.spotify.com/show/770yQOSF9mSLByAmIs3HoI?si=sgleciQPRcKxWZuD50JjDg). We got through only 5 out of 10 ideas I had prepared, but we plan on another chat soon. It's not published yet though. I follow Jakob on twitter and am very **inspired by his journey** and [approach to ideation](https://jakobgreenfeld.com/gut).
- I had a chat with [Daniel K. Hunter](https://twitter.com/danielkhunter?lang=en), another twitter friend I was introduced to via Jakob. He's working on a newsletter called [Indie Drops](https://indiedrops.com/) you should check out if you're into early-stage **startup deals**. 
- I spoke on the phone with a [YC StartupSchool ](https://www.startupschool.org/) connection, Amit, about an **interview practice platform** for Indian students. 
I'm particularly interested in the idea because India is a burgeoning market with a talented young workforce, 
but lacking soft skills that are expected in more western companies.

💔 Lowlights
- I had a shouting match with my father over, guess what, not wiping down the dinner table. I'll probably write a blog post about **micro aggressions**, which I attribute to this large outburst over such a small thing. I've never behaved like this with anyone other than my parents, which is both a relief and disappointing.

✅ Completed
- I wrote a better 'Welcome' email for new subscribers. I had been collecting these sorts of emails over time as I subscribed to many newsletters myself. I really started looking at newsletters with a **deconstructive eye**, while I was preparing to make one myself. 
- I added a whole bunch of **DNS records** to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) so I could verify my custom email address and [EmailOctopus](https://emailoctopus.com/?ali=285006c3-46ad-11eb-a3d0-06b4694bee2a) sender address. This is crucial or else this newsletter would never make it past your spam filter. If you need help with this let me know!
- I attempted to add a **comment section** for blog posts on my site, but there wasn't a great free option that allowed anonymous comments without OAuth. I'll probably just create a simple html form that submits to an [Airtable](https://airtable.com/invite/r/9IfgMyZL). Then use the Airtable API to display them once I've moderated them.

🎯 Goals
- Resume a weekly **check-in meeting** my local friends and I started at the end of 2020. I'll feature them in a future edition because they are amazing and inspire me to be better. 
- Celebrate my **100 day** 'anniversary' with my girlfriend. 
It's a numerologically significant milestone in Korean dating culture 🤷
- Start working on my first ProductHunt launch for January. 
It's a tongue in cheek idea I can quickly make, called **'Lucky Charm'** (working title). More on this to come next week~


📖 Book
<br>
I'm currently reading **[Zero To Sold](https://thebootstrappedfounder.com/zero-to-sold/)** having been impressed with Arvid's newsletter output lately.


🎵 Song <br>
[Lunch Break](https://youtu.be/3ArmYP1nklI) - MF DOOM (Prod. Flying Lotus)
My favorite rapper **MF Doom**'s death was recently announced by his wife...I have no words, but that's ok because he had the best.


🎙️ Podcast <br>
[This episode on favorite words of the year by a16z](https://a16z.com/2020/12/24/word-of-the-year-2020-words-metaphors-interfaces-tech-language-dictionaries-internet/) was very intriguing. I learned that "**parasocial**" is the relationship I have with my favorite podcast hosts (it's a one way street, but I still feel like I know them personally).

As for you and me though, we don't have to be parasocial. How was this first edition of the newsletter? Hit reply with your feedback, so I can make it better for you. 


Talk soon, 

Andrew

<!-- Essentially, I will leverage my unique member id on ProductHunt (#777777) as a user who can engage and give feedback on new ProductHunt launches. My thinking here is that I can leverage my objectively insignificant ID, to potentially create my own luck in connecting with other makers (who also have a sense of humor and superstition).  -->
