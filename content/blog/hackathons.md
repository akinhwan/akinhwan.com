## Moments & Milestones

What I learned from winning 6 hackathons, and over $10,000 in prizes
- how to effectively present/pitch
	-not too much text
	-the demo should be the bulk of it
	-think in reverse, what will be shown in the pitch
	-take time to get to know other competitors
	-ask judges questions/help, don't just be heads down
- fun swag, shirts, stickers
